General notes for the development process:
not really meant to make any sense to anyone but me at the moment

q.select(Person, Country).where(
    {name: "William"}, {name: "England"}
)

q.select(Person).where(
    {name: "William"}
)

str(q) to fetch translation?

could use inspect for lambda based query also

this doesn't work since pass-by-value:
q.select(Person.profession).where(
    Person="William"
)

would have to be like
Person.select(Person.profession).where(Person="william")

should also allow string arguments like
q.select("Person.profession") so that the above can be easily automated


----

class Person:
  movement = ""
  placeofbirth = ""
  coordinates = Linked("", "placeofbirth")

q.select(Person, Person.coordinates).where(
  Person.movement="pre raphaelite"
)

->
SELECT ?person ?coordinates WHERE {
  ?person movement PreRaph
  ?person placeofbirth ?placeofbirth
  ?placeofbirth coordinates ?coordinates
}
